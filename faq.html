            <h3 class="prompt">What is 1StopConEd.com?</h3>
            <p>1 Stop ConEd LLC is a provider of home-study (distance learning) Michigan real estate continuing education courses.  Our courses are designed to offer our students the most information, as quickly as possible.  We specialize in providing continuing education only to Michigan real estate professionals.</p>
            <p>Because we offer home-study real estate con ed courses, you can complete your continuing education at any time from anywhere. The days of scheduling time off to drive to and sit for a continuing education class in a hotel or conference room are over.  1StopConEd.com puts you in control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">What is home study?</h3>
            <p>Home study is a quick and convenient way to complete your continuing education hours.  Home study allows you to do your con ed from your home/workplace without attending classes.  It allows you to control your rate of progress, on your time schedule.  You simply download our course material (PDF format booklet) and start reading.  It’s that simple.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">How is 1 Stop ConEd different from other online real estate continuing education courses?</h3>
            <p>Our courses are better than other "online courses."  With our courses, you instantly download the entire course.  You can print the course and read it or simply read it on your computer.  With other distance learning courses, you have to sit in front of a computer screen the entire time, but with our courses you can print the material and read it anywhere.  Also, other distance learning courses track your time, but with our courses you track your own time.  With other courses, there is also the risk of computer or internet malfunctions, which may require you to re-start the course.  Our courses are simple – simply download and read!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">Are your courses approved?</h3>
            <p>Yes. To be eligible to satisfy the LARA’s real estate continuing education requirements, continuing education schools and their courses must be reviewed and certified by a statewide real estate association with a membership of more than 18,000 licensees.  CE Marketplace, a division of Michigan Realtors, has certified 1 Stop ConEd LLC, as well as all of its courses!  Your continuing education is GUARANTEED with 1 Stop ConEd LLC!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">Who writes your course material?</h3>
            <p>Our courses are written by two experienced, practicing attorneys/real estate brokers who have the same needs and goals as you.  Our continuing education courses are specifically designed for Michigan real estate professionals.  That means we do not resell generic courses from national education vendors, as some of our competitors do.  From our experience, those “generic” courses – courses not written specifically for Michigan licensees – often contain misinformation and irrelevant material because they were written using the laws and regulations of another state (not Michigan).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">What are the options for payment?</h3>
            <p>We accept payments through our secure partner Stripe. You are able to use any major credit card, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and Interac.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">Is it safe to use my credit card?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! Our website will <b>never</b> store your card information, and all financial transactions are carried out securely through Stripe. Both our website and Stripe employ Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to ensure that your information will never be shared with anyone. The transaction information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as scrambled code, and decrypted on the credit card processor’s secure server.  Therefore, your credit card information is secure and cannot be read in transit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">Do I need to start reading a course right away after downloading it?</h3>
            <p>No. With our courses, there is no "time clock" and no need to log in and out of the course.  You can download the course and open the file and start whenever you like.  We recommend saving the course material directly to your computer's hard drive so you'll have available at any time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">Do I need to take a quiz?</h3>
            <p>Yes. You must take a short, 10-quesiton review quiz after reading the course material.  The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs requires that we administer a quiz to ensure that students have reviewed the material.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">What is a passing grade for the quiz?</h3>
            <p>You must score at least 80% on the easy 10-question quiz to pass.  Most people pass the first time, but if you don’t you will have another opportunity to take the test again at no charge, until you pass!  No re-take fees!  After you pass, we’ll email you a copy of the Certificate of Completion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">What if I don't pass the quiz?</h3>
            <p>Most people pass the first time, but if you don’t you will have another opportunity to take the test again at no charge, until you pass!  No re-take fees!  After you pass, we’ll email you a copy of the Certificate of Completion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">How and when do I get my Certificate of Completion?</h3>
            <p>You must score at least 80% on an easy 10-question quiz. Once you do, we’ll email you a copy of the Certificate of Completion for the course in minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">What day will my course be considered complete?</h3>
            <p>Courses are considered complete for reporting purposes on the day that you submit your passing quiz.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">How long does it take to complete a course?</h3>
            <p>It’s entirely up to you.  You work at your own pace; do a little each day or you can complete it all at once. You’ll be done before you know it.</p><p>Our courses are based on a 50-minute clock hour.  So, for example, a two hour course would take approximately 100 minutes.  Because people read at different speeds, some people may finish the course much quicker than others.  The great thing about our con ed courses is that you work at your own pace.  No one is sitting over your shoulder making you slow down or speed up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">What if I have questions about course content?</h3>
            <p>We are here to answer any questions you might have. You can call us at (313) 850-4433 or (248) 808-0011 with questions Monday-Friday, between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.  You can also send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@1stopconed.com">info@1StopConEd.com</a>.

        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt"> Do you submit my course completion to CE Marketplace?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Starting in November 2018, continuing education providers must upload attendance information to CE Marketplace no later than 10 business days from the completion date of the course. As a result, in addition to receiving a certificate of completion from 1 Stop ConEd LLC, your course completion will be reported to CE Marketplace.

        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="prompt">Can I get a refund?</h3>
            <p>Yes.  We want you to be fully satisfied with your experience with 1StopConEd.com.  That’s why we will gladly refund your money in full if you are unsatisfied with any of our courses. All requests for refunds must be made in writing via email and sent to <a href="refunds@1stopconed.com">refunds@1StopConEd.com</a> within three (3) days of purchase and only if 1 Stop ConEd LLC has not already issued you a Certificate of Completion for that course.
